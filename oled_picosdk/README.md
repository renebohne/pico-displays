This example was taken from https://github.com/daschr/pico-ssd1306
and modified to just show the very basic functionalities.

# RUN

Be sure that you have the pico-sdk installed and `PICO_SDK_PATH` set.

```bash
cd build
cmake ..
make
```

Then you can copy the `ssd1306-example.uf2` file to your Raspberry Pi pico.

E.g., on a Mac:
```bash
cp ssd1306-example.uf2 /Volumes/RPI-RP2
```
